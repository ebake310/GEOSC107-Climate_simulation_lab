# GEOSC107-Climate_simulation_lab
Lab  â€“ Projected Climate Model Data:  Working with Multidimensional Datasets in Python

In this lab, you'll map historical and projected climate data in Python, which would not be possible in a software like Excel due to the size and multidimensionality of the datasets. You'll assess both local and global air temperatures, as well as how air temperatures are projected to change in the future according to an ensemble of cmip5 climate models depending on to two RCP emission scenarios.
